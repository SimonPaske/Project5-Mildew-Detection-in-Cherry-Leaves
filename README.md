**Powdery Mildew Detector App**

The Powdery Mildew Detector is an application designed to predict whether cherry leaves are healthy or infected with powdery mildew. The app utilizes a supervised, single-label, binary classification machine learning model. Specifically, a binary classifier is employed to predict the outcome based on an image of a cherry leaf, categorizing it as either healthy or infected.

## Bugs and Fixes

# Bug: Unwanted .DS_Store Files in Project Directories

## Issue Description

While working on the project, I encountered the issue of unwanted .DS_Store files are created by macOS in a project directories. These files are system files created by the Finder to store custom attributes of a folder, such as the position of icons and view settings. However, they are not intended to be included in version control or project repositories.

## Solution

To address this issue and prevent the inclusion of `.DS_Store` files in the project directories, can be done in these steps:

1. **Configure Git to Ignore .DS_Store Files:**
   - Create or modify the `.gitignore` file in your project's root directory.
   - Add the following line to the `.gitignore` file:
     ```
     .DS_Store
     ```
   - Save and commit the changes to the `.gitignore` file.

   This will instruct Git to ignore any `.DS_Store` files in the project, preventing them from being added to the version control system.

2. **Remove Existing .DS_Store Files:**
   - Manually delete any existing `.DS_Store` files in your project directories.
   - You can use the following command in the terminal to remove them recursively from a directory:
     ```bash
     find . -type f -name ".DS_Store" -delete
     ```
   - Alternatively, you can navigate to the project directories and delete the files manually.

## Conclusion

The issue of unwanted `.DS_Store` files in project directories is a common occurrence on macOS systems. By configuring Git to ignore these files and removing any existing occurrences, I ensure that they do not interfere with version control or project consistency.

Adding the `.DS_Store` entry to the `.gitignore` file prevents these files from being accidentally committed to the repository, reducing unnecessary changes in version history and ensuring a cleaner project structure.

By following the provided solution, you can maintain a more organized and repository-friendly project environment, free from the interference of system-specific files.
